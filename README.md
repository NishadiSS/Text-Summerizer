# Simple Text Summarization Model

## Objective 
The objective of this project is to develop a basic text summarization model using Jupyter Notebook. The aim is to create a tool that can automatically generate concise summaries of longer texts while preserving the essential information. This involves implementing and evaluating different summarization techniques, such as extractive and abstractive methods, to understand their effectiveness in generating meaningful and coherent summaries.
